     * white color if you wish

     * SUMMATIVE OPTIONAL Make it so that some of your constructors (including
     * possibly the default) use a random number to set the position and/or speed of
     * the object.
     * 
     * SUMMATIVE OPTIONAL Add more than two constructors for varying levels of
     * customization
